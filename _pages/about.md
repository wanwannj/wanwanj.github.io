I'm WAN Wan(万万), a first-year Ph.D. student in School of [Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/main.htm). My research interests are in **Cultural Studies**, **Social Media** and **Digital Humanities**.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Radio & Television Editing and Directing, at the **Nanjing University of the Arts**. For research interest, I participated in Government Scholarship Exchange Program in the **University of Pennsylvania** to learn Culture and Museum Studies. I graduated from **The University of Hong Kong** with a master’s degree in Information Technology in Education, and joined two academic conferences on ICT (Information and Communications Technology)  in Hong Kong and France.
